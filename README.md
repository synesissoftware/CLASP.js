## Introduction

T.B.C.

## Installation & usage

Install using `npm install clasp-js`.

Use it via `require('clasp-js')`.

### The name

NOTE: the name **clasp-js** follows [NPM's package-name rules](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json), but breaks with one of the tips - the one about not including **js** or **node** in the name - because there are multiple CLASP libraries, and there already exists a [**clasp** package in **NPM**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clasp).

## Components

T.B.C.

## Examples

Examples are provided in the ```examples``` directory, along with a markdown description for each. A detailed list TOC of them is provided in [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md).
